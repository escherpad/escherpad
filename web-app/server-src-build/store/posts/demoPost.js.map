It is a free web-based editor that saves your notes locally in your browser\\'s `LocalStorage`, that can be connected to your Dropbox, GitHub, and Google Drive accounts. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is betten than exsting markdown editors because\\r\\n1. [x] editor supports both <kbd>vim<\\/kbd> and <kbd>emacs<\\/kbd>, \\r\\n2. [x] the preview is styled with **100%** fidelity to GitHub\\r\\n3. [x] the synchronized scrolling is anchored by cursor. So what you are editing in preview is always going to be right next to where your cursor is in the editor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of Gittor is taken from what I did for the WYSIWYG real-time collaborative notebook [Escherpad](http:\\/\\/escherpad.com), while the development is done such that I can kickass with react for the 2.0 version of Escherpad.\\r\\n\\r\\n## About Me\\r\\n\\r\\nMy name is Ge Yang, I\\'m a fifth year physics graduate student at the University of Chicago. I am trying to build a new type of quantum computer in the lab with a single electron floating on the surface of super fluid helium.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Part One: Standard Markdown Syntax\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tables\\r\\n\\r\\nA table can be made like this:\\r\\ninline style            | syntax             | comments\\r\\n----------------------- | ------------------ | -----------\\r\\n*emphasis* (italic)     | *                  | no space after the first delimiter or before last\\r\\n**bold**                | **                 | same as above\\r\\n~~strike through~~      | ~~                 | same\\r\\n`inline code block`     | \\\\` (back tick)     | usually the key <kbd>~<\\/kbd> under your <kbd>esc<\\/kbd> key.\\r\\n<mark>highlight<\\/mark>  | `<mark><\\/mark>`    | \\r\\n<kbd>key<\\/kbd>          | `<kbd><\\/kbd>`      | \\r\\n[link]()                | `[text](link-url)` |\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### horizontal line\\r\\nTo type horizontal line, do `---` or `***`.\\r\\nfor example:\\r\\n```\\r\\n---\\r\\n```\\r\\ngives you a horizontal line like below:\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\nAn alternative syntax is to use three `*` like `***`. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Part Two: Advanced GitHub Flavored Markdown\\r\\n### Task Lists\\r\\nHave you ever opened up your notebook just want to write down some todos? In GitHub flavored markdown, you make todo lists by typing `- [ ]` or `- [x]` for completed items. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```markdown\\r\\n- [x] you can check off a list like this\\r\\n- [ ] and have more items\\r\\n    - [x] even sub lists.\\r\\n```\\r\\ngets you: \\r\\n- [x] you can check off a list like this\\r\\n- [ ] and have more items\\r\\n    - [x] even sub lists.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Ordered Task Lists\\r\\nIt turned out that you can do this to ordered lists as well! \\r\\n```markdown\\r\\n1. [x] remember to leave the correct spacing\\r\\n    1. [ ] and it works in sub lists as well.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n1. [x] remember to leave the correct spacing\\r\\n    1. [ ] and it works in sub list as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Code Blocks\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to insert a block of code, you can use the  <code>```<\\/code> mark (three backticks) to deliminate such a code block. An optional languange parameter after the opening backticks can be used to specify the languange for the syntax highlighting. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n    ```python\\r\\n    for i in range(10):\\r\\n        print i; \\/\\/ we should all use python 3 syntax now!\\r\\n    ```\\r\\n```\\r\\n gives you:\\r\\n \\r\\n```python\\r\\nfor i in range(10):\\r\\n    print i; \\/\\/ we should all use python 3 syntax now!\\r\\n```\\r\\n### \\u7ED8\\u6587\\u5B57 or Emoji:)\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can find a full list of supported emoji on [this cheat sheet](http:\\/\\/www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com)!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Part Three: Other Goodies Not Available in GFM but supported on Gittor\\r\\n\\r\\nThese features are in fact part of CommonMark and available widely in various systems.\\r\\n### References\\r\\nWhen is the last time you see someone using a footnote in their blog[^foot-note-1]? To add footnotes, you just need to type `[^` and then the id of your footnote, followed by `]`. Now to write the content of the footnote, write: `[^id-of-your-footnote]: content of your footnote` anywhere you want. \\r\\n\\r\\n[^foot-note-1]: here is a foot note\\r\\n\\r\\n### Inline and Display Math\\r\\n**Inline Math**\\\\\\r\\nTo type inline math, use `$` to deliminate LaTeX. Remember to **not** leave empty space after the first deliminator or before the closing one.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Display Math**\\\\\\r\\nTo type display math, those equation blocks that seem to live between lines, do\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\\\\sigma_x = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\r\\n                                    \\\\begin{matrix}\\r\\n                                        0 & i \\\\\\\\\\r\\n                                        -i & 0 \\r\\n                                    \\\\end{matrix}\\r\\n                                \\\\right)\\r\\n$$\\r\\n\"\n}\n"]}
