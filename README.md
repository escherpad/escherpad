# Escherpad

A direct neural link to your past, your team, and the world

The most intuitive and beautiful notebook you will ever use, a marriage between org-mode, Evernote, Jupyter notebook and Mathematica. 

A CS student's wet dream, and a designer's best friend.

It all starts here.

## To Develop

Please refer to README files in each project folder. There are detailed instructions on what to do.

To share the `client-common` folder with app projects, we use `git subtree`. Details on this tool can be found
[here (atlassian)]. Please take a look at the link and understand `git subtree` before development.
